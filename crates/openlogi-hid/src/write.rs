//! HID++ writes back to the device — DPI, SmartShift, lighting, and diagnostics.
//!
//! Each entry point takes a [`DeviceRoute`] and resolves it to an open channel
//! through `open_route_channel`, so the same call works whether the device is
//! behind a Bolt receiver or attached directly (USB cable / Bluetooth). Each
//! call re-enumerates and re-opens — fine at the frequency this is invoked
//! (once per slider release) — unless a [`SharedChannel`] from the capture
//! session is reused.
